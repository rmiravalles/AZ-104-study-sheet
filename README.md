# AZ-104-study-sheet

This is an Excel spreadsheet I created to help me and everybody else who wants to grab it to study for the Azure Administrator (AZ-104) exam.

There are links to Microsoft Docs material, and when applicable, links to hands-on labs, also offered by Microsoft. Everything's free.

There's a "confidence level" cell. I saw this on the self-assessment tools created by the super nice folks from https://build5nines.com/. You can select between 3 states: no idea, know a little or know well, to more or lesse guide you through your studies, to know where to focus more. Theirs is more complex, with calculations. Mine is just a visual queue for you to have an idea of your knowledge level.

Please feel free to comment, to point any mistakes, or to add anything you feel will improve this document. It's a work in progress, and this is just the first version.

I hope you find it useful.

Thank you!
