# AZ-104-study-sheet

Hi!

This is an Excel spreadsheet I created to help me and everybody else who wants to grab it to study for the Azure Administrator (AZ-104) exam.

I divided the workbook in columns according to the skills measured. For each topic, there are links to Microsoft Docs material, and when applicable, links to hands-on labs, also offered by Microsoft. Everything's free.

The last row's the "confidence level". I saw this on the self-assessment tools created by the super nice folks from https://build5nines.com/. You can select between 3 states: no idea (red), know a little (yellow) or know well (green). It can help you in assessing your knowledge of the specific topic for later reference. Theirs is more complex, with calculations. Mine is just a visual queue for you to have an idea of your knowledge level, and to see what topics need more attention.

## What I'm using to study for the exam

Besides Microsoft Docs, these are my other study sources:

* Scott Duffy's Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/70533-azure/
* Cloudskills: https://portal.cloudskills.io/az-104
* Different Pluralsight courses. Microsoft and Pluralsight partnered to offer free Azure courses. The access to the platform is limited, though. Just Azure specific courses. You shouldn't miss this opportunity. I believe it has an end, so grab it ASAP! Here's the link to redeem the benefit: https://www.pluralsight.com/partners/microsoft/azure?aid=7010a000001xDURAA2
* Exam Ref AZ-103 Microsoft Azure Administrator book from Microsoft Press: https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/exam-ref-az-103-microsoft-azure-administrator-9780135466582
* For hands-on labs, I've been going throug the ones published by Azure Citadel (https://azurecitadel.com/)

Please feel free to comment, to point any mistakes, or to add anything you feel will improve this document. It's a work in progress, and this is just the first version.

I hope you find it useful.

Thank you!
